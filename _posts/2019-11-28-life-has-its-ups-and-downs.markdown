Life has its ups and downs. Unfortunately, it looked like people around me out of luck. My boss leaved, My wife got in an accident and I had to break my piggy bank for some reason. Even so, no matter what happens, life must go on.

> “Let it rain on some days,
Let yourself shiver on some cold nights,
So when it's Spring you'll know why it was all worth going through.”
― Sanhita Baruah

Earlier this year, I promised to my wife I’ll go to Dhamma retreat with her. So, it was perfect timing to get away from it all. After coming back home, problems still didn’t solve, but I learned to accept the truth and didn’t drown in the sorrow.

Thanks my wife, she was the best gift in my entire life.
Love you my present ❤️.
