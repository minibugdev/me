Feedback is important, so I met other team leaders to talk about “What are feedbacks we need to realize?”. 
As a result, there are 3 subjects that we need to realize as follows:
- Team progress.
- The problems we met.
- The action items to solve the problems.

However, we need the time to get feedback from our teams and prepare the presentation. Thus, we appointed the meeting on the first Tuesday of every month to up date the feedback.

Then, the next meeting is on 3rd September. Unfortunately, there is a lack of time to be prepared.

While coming back home, I listened podcast “We need to talk [EP.06](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6S75SCREJLc0gReodg09Y5)” which the guest was Sueching. She earned her nickname, “IT Angel” because she was hosting the show on Voice TV named Cool Tech. 

They talked about her background why she appealed to technology. Later, she reviewed about life in the US when she joined the AFS program. At the end, the host asked for her opinion about a wedding ceremony and supernatural.
