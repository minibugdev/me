When I studied at the university. I loved to roaming around and taking photos with my friends. So, I broke my piggy bank to buy a DSRL camera one.

Since I got it, I took lots of photos, especially girls 😻. Anyway, I've got less time to do those things after I started to work. Later, I sold it out.

Last month, My university's senior asked me to take a photo for his PhD commencement ceremony. At first, I wasn't sure if I could do it because I've never done something like this before plus no camera.

Eventhough, how hard I tried to decline, he insisted saying that “Don’t worry, I just want photos and keep a memory”. At Last , I accepted and became a photographer for him with my friend's camera at this day.
