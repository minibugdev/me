When I studied at the university. I loved to go around with my friends and took photos. So, I broke my piggy bank and bought a DSRL camera one.

Since I got it, I took lots of photos, especially girls 😻. Anyway, there were less times to do those things after I started to work. Later, I sold it out.

In the last month, my university senior asked me to take a photo for his PhD commencement ceremony. At first, I didn’t sure could I did it because I didn’t have experiences and camera.

Although I tried to decline, he said that “Don’t worry, I just want photos and keep a memory”. So, I accepted and became to photographer for him at this day.
