Yesterday, I had the mission to give the feedback of my team on 3rd September. So, I asked for help from my teammates to fill up the presentation before next Tuesday.

A few hours later, I read an article “[SOLID Design Principles](https://saladpuk.gitbook.io/learn/basic/solid)” and discussed with my teammates. While we were discussing, Many people were interested in this topic and joined with us.

I was surprised but also enjoyed at the same time. Even though I understood only some parts of it, But it was the beginning of sharing and learning new things.
