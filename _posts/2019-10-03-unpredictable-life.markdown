Nobody knows the future, so much can happen in our life. 

My friend texted to me he has appendicitis and have to admit to the hospital. I asked what can I help him. Then, He told he need a person to keep vigil over a sick because of the hospital’s rules. So, I was that guy.

This was my first time, All people in the hospital were hectic, nurses roamed around, other patients snored. Accordingly, I couldn’t sleep and felt sleepy for a whole day.

Because of this, I realized that I should take care of myself more and go out to exercise.
