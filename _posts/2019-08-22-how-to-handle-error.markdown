I started the day by discussing with my team. We were trying to fix a bug. We founded a few solutions. In the end, we decided to select the one that having less impact to overall project plus clear to implement even if it broke some rules of our project. 

Besides, we kick ideas around on how to deal with an error in the long run to reduce duplicate code. However, we didn’t find the way out yet, but at least there are articles for reference ([article 1](https://www.ackee.cz/blog/en/exception-and-error-handling/), [article 2](https://smedialink.com/development/flexible-way-for-error-handling-in-android/)). Anyway, We still need more information. So we’ll research and discuss afterward.
