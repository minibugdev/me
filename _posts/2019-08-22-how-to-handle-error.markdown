I started the day by discussing with my teams for looking for the solution to fix a bug. We founded a few solutions. So in conclusion, we accepted the low impact way and clear to implement even if it broke some rule of our project. 

Besides, we kick ideas around on how to deal with an error in the long run to reduce duplicate code. However, we didn’t found the solution yet, but there are articles for reference ([article 1](https://www.ackee.cz/blog/en/exception-and-error-handling/), [article 2](https://smedialink.com/development/flexible-way-for-error-handling-in-android/)). Anyway, we need more information so we’ll research and discuss afterward.
