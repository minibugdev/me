Two weeks ago, I wrote [360° Feedback](https://minibugdev.github.io/me/2019/09/10/peer-feedback.html) about in our company we gave feedback to each other. Afterward, HR team sent the report to us. Surly, my teammates also got feedbacks report.

Technically, I am a team leader, so I also got their reports to discussed with them. So, today I invited my teammates to talk with me one by one. We discussed feedback and their expectations.

Fortunately, the most of the feedback was optimistic, and they were satisfied. Eventually, I felt thrilled because I did my job done and everything was all right.
