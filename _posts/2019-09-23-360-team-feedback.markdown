Two weeks ago, I wrote [360° Feedback](https://minibugdev.github.io/me/2019/09/10/peer-feedback.html). Afterward, HR team sent the report to us. Obviously, my teammates also got feedbacks report.

Technically, I am a team leader, so I also got their reports to discussed with them. Thus, today I invited my teammates to share with me one by one. We discussed feedback and their expectations.

Fortunately, Most of the feedback was optimistic, and they were satisfied. Eventually, I felt thrilled because I have done my job and everything was all right.
