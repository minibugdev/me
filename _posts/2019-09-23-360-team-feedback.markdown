Technically, I am team's leader so I also got their reports for discussed with them.

Today, I invited my teammates to talked with me one by one. We discussed about feedbacks and their expectations.

Fortunately, the most of feedbacks were optimistic and my teammates satisfied.

Eventually, I felt very happy because my job was done and everything were all right.
