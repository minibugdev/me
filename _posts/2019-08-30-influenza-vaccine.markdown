Take an Influenza vaccine is one of my company welfares. This vaccine protects us from the dangerous virus. Anyway, vaccine inject pathogens into our body so there is some side effect e.g. have a fever, pain in some part of body.

Today is the second round to take a vaccine. I missed the first round because after that day I would go to my friend’s wedding ceremony. Therefore, I skipped the first round and registered for taking a vaccine on the second round.
