Taking an influenza vaccine is one of my company’s welfares. This vaccine protects us from the dangerous virus. Nevertheless, vaccine inject pathogens into our body so there are some side effects e.g. having a fever, painful in some part of the body.

Today is the second round to take a vaccine. I missed the first round because after that day I would go to my friend’s wedding ceremony. Therefore, I skipped the first round and registered for taking a vaccine on the second round.
