On the weekend, I dozed for a whole day. I actually planed to write the previous daily but it was still a plan. Anyway, Rest days are important, so I was just laying down for this weekend then left the writing on Monday.

> Each night, when I go to sleep, I die. And the next morning, when I wake up, I am reborn. â€• Mahatma Gandhi

On Monday morning, my colleague told me about [MOBILE CONF 2019](https://mobileconfth.com/) which they went on Saturday. After that, I bounce some ideas off them about the contents on that event.

Finally, I opened to write a daily in a few hours later.
