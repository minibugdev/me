On the weekend, I dozed for a whole day and planned to write past daily but it still a plan. Anyway, rest days are important, so I lay down on the weekend and will write a daily on Monday.

> Each night, when I go to sleep, I die. And the next morning, when I wake up, I am reborn. â€• Mahatma Gandhi

On Monday morning, my colleague told me about [MOBILE CONF 2019](https://mobileconfth.com/) which they went on Saturday. After that, I bounce some ideas off them about the contents on that event.

Finally, I opened to write a daily in a few hours later.
