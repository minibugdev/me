At noon, while I was sitting on the chair feeling sleepy. Suddenly, my colleague shouted “Let’s go to attend Tape’s knowledge sharing”. Then, I awoke and decided to join their party because I thought it would be funnier than felt drowsy alone.

On the sharing, Tape talked about main concepts and basic usages of ReactJS. Which was JavaScript library for building website.

Moreover, he said that most of websites builded by ReactJS would use ReduxJS to manage a state.

In the end, he told us today was a rehearsal. He would revise presentation and add more examples.
