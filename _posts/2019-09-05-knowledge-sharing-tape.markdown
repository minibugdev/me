At noon, while I sat on the chair and felt sleepy. Suddenly, my colleague shouted “Let’s go to attend Tape’s knowledge sharing”. Then, I awoke and joined their party because I thought it would be funnier than felt drowsy at the chair.

On the sharing, Tape shared about main concepts and basic usages of ReactJS. Which was JavaScript library for building website.

Moreover, he told the most project that building by ReactJS use ReduxJS to manage a state.

In the end, he said today is a rehearsal. He would revise presentation and add more examples.
