On yesterday, I had the mission to give the feedback of my team on 3rd September. So, I asked for help from my teammates to fulfil the presentation before next Tuesday.

A few hours later, I read an article “[SOLID Design Principles](https://saladpuk.gitbook.io/learn/basic/solid)” and discussed with my teammates. While we are discussing, there are many people interested in this topic and join with us.

I wondered but enjoyed as well. Anyway, I understand only some part, but it is the beginning of sharing and learning new things.
