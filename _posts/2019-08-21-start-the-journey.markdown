Today, I started to create this site to practice my English by daily a routine. After search technology, I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because it was easy to build up and free. There are a bunch of templates just pick one and customize it. I chose [Type Theme](https://github.com/rohanchandra/type-theme) the simple template. After setup and customize for my style, I wrote the first daily and deployed on [Minibug's Journey](https://minibugdev.github.com/me).
