Today, I started to create this site to practice my English by writing a daily. After searching for all technology I could, I finally going for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because it was easy to build up and FREE. 

Moreover, there are a bunch of templates. All I need to do is just pick one and customize it. Then I chose [Type Theme](https://github.com/rohanchandra/type-theme) the simple one.

After setting up and customizing into my style, I wrote the first daily and deployed on [Minibug's Journey](https://minibugdev.github.com/me).
