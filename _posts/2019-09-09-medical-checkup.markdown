Annual health checkups are important. It helps us know what's going on inside our bodies and which things we should avoid.

In the past, I didn’t realize about healthy. I loved to eat junk food, snacks and coca cola. 3 years ago, I checked up and found a fat factor higher than the standard. Then, I tried to eat them less and exercise more.

Today is an annual health checkup day. The standard packages didn’t have enough details. So, I bought more checkup packages.

Although, It would take a long time for the results. But I was still waiting because I wish to have a good health and get along with my family as long as I can.
