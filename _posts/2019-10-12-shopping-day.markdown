> “If you would be wealthy, think of saving as well as getting.” — Benjamin Franklin

This year, Thailand’s governance aims to stimulate the economy through a “Chim-Shop-Chai” campaign. Which, give the money to the people 1,000 bath and let them go out for tasting, shopping and spending.

Absolutely, I didn’t miss it and planned to spend the money for a new laptop bag and wallet.

Today, I told my wife I wanna eat Khao Soi Kai near Union mall. So, we went to Union mall before heading to Central Ladprao for shopping. Although, both of us got 2,000 bath, but we spent 3,600 bath. 

### "What is this? Why we spent over expected?"
