Hi, long time no see, I have to say the same word “time flies”. There are so many things happen in 2020, especially the World crisis “COVID-19” pandemic. It affects to everybody, many people die, world economy collapse and some business have to shut down or reduce their cost.

Unfortunately, my wife work on travel and tourism industry so she has to leave her dream job behind and go back to Thailand, but on the other hand this is a good chance for her to looking for the new journey. And at least we can stay together.

My company also affected, we have to reduce cost, start to WFH and adjust the business to survive in this crisis. Luckily, I still have the job.

Because of WFH, you can do anything whenever you want, but you must have the discipline. Sadly, I don’t have that much. I waste my time with games, social media, Youtube and Netflix. Even though I finish my duty, but it would be better if I can manipulate time.

Although everything seems so bad, I have been promoted. The new position is a super challenge for me because I’m not strong in that field and the timeline is tight, but this is a wonderful opportunity to break out of my comfort zone. Then, challenge accept!!

The other good thing in 2020 is I receive an invitation for an interview from Facebook London, but unfortunately it’s beyond my ability. However, I’ll improve and won’t miss on the second chance.

Last but not least, Happy New Year 2021 🎉🎉🎉
