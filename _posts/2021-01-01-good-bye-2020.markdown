Hi, long time no see, I have to say the same word "time flies". There are so many things happen in 2020 especially the World crisis "COVID-19" pandemic. It affect to everybody, a lot of people die, world economy collapse and some business have to shut down or reduce their cost. 

Unfortunately, my wife work on travel and tourism industry so she have to leave her dream job behind and go back to Thailand, but on the other hand this is great chance for her to looking for the new journey. And at least, we can stay together.

My company also affected, we have to reduce cost, start to WFH and adjust the business to survive in this crisis. Luckily, I still have the job.

I have to adapt myself also, because WFH
