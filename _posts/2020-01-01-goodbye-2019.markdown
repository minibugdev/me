I still remembered that I was looking back at what went on in last year on this day, time flies!. Unfortunately, I wrote nothing so this blog I’ll write my 2019 year in review.

First, I tried to learn English by writing something on this blog. Besides, my wife supported me. Yes! I learned English from her. Even though I am still poor in English, I have improved.

For my work, most of my work was about reviewing code and fixing some issues. Sometimes I was assigned to write codes for other team. But I thought I could do better, it wasn't my best version. I felt Burn out and tried to find the way out. For this reason, my friends and I worked together to do the freelance projects. Luckily, I enjoyed working with them and helped me leave from Burn out.

A few years ago, I loved to join meetup so much, but this year I wasted a whole time on a sofa and watched YouTube. Anyway, I was the staff of some meetup and on last meetup I was the moderator. Even though it made me excited, But I really enjoyed.

As I wrote before about lift that [life has its ups and downs](https://minibugdev.github.io/me/2019/11/28/life-has-its-ups-and-downs.html). My friend who worked with me for 5 years and my underling left. My wife got an accident. I had to take care of my friend in the hospital for 2 nights.

Even if everything looked like bad, there are many grate things happened. My brother graduated. I went to Dhamma retreat. I contributed an open-source projects and got lots of good feedback. Moreover, I met new people who's from Grab SG. He shared his experience in work and life in the international company. I really appreciated and inspired me to go out to explore the World.
