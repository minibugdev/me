I still remembered that I was looking back at what went on in last year on this day, time flies!. Unfortunately, I wrote nothing so this blog I’ll write my 2019 year in review.

First, I tried to learn English by writing something on this blog. Besides, my wife supported me. Yes! I learned English from her. Even though I still poor in English, I improved.

For my work, most of my work was reviewing code and fixing some issues. Sometimes I was assigned to write codes for others teams. But I thought I could well this didn’t my best version. I felt Burn out and tried to find the way out. For this reason, my friends and I work together to do the freelance projects. Luckily, I enjoyed working with them and help me left from Burn out.

A few years ago, I loved to join meetup so much, but this year I wasted a whole time on a sofa and watched YouTube. Anyway, I was the staff of some meetup and on last meetup I was the moderator. Even though it made me excited, I really enjoyed.

Even if everything looked like bad, there are many things grate happened. My brother graduated. I went to Dhamma retreat. I contributed open-source projects and got lots of good feedback. Moreover, I met new people who from Grab SG. He shared his experience in work and life in the international company. I really appreciated and inspired me to do something like him.
