### Daily life #1

Like every other day, nothing to do in the morning. 
I only checked the emails, GitHub notifications, and surf social network.

In the evening, I discussed with teams and HR about Hackathon. 
I showed the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EyEEpHazr-GofrKt1GSXV3bwQmhJYyFq5VDYKrqWM1E) that they assigned me to research.

After the discussion, we have no conclusion and need more information. 
So, HR team will research more before the schedule for the next meeting.
