Hacktoberfest® is an event that let developers help drive growth of open source by contributing a project in October yearly. Participants would receive a T-shirt from sponsors.

2 years ago, I finished the event by contributing my Android library called [DrawableBadge](https://github.com/minibugdev/DrawableBadge). I’ve been proud of this project because it got 116 stars from developers around the World.

Last year, I missed the event. Honestly I didn't remember why. I must had been busying doing something.

This year, I won't miss it again. I started early by contributing a library named [Alerter](https://github.com/Tapadoo/Alerter) that got 4,500+ stars. Luckily, the owner accepted my pull request and let my feature release to new major version.
