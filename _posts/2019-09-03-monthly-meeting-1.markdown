On 27th August, I wrote about [Feedback Loops](https://minibugdev.github.io/me/2019/08/27/feedback-loops.html). After we discussed and filled up information. Eventually, this evening was a presentation day. All team leads including me were in the meeting room and started to present.

We thought it would take a few minutes per person, But we took more than 10 minutes per person. Moreover, there were questions in some point that took time to answer.

Finally, we took 2 hours to finish the meeting and went back home.
