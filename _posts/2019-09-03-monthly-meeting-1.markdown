On 27th August, I told about [Feedback Loops](https://minibugdev.github.io/me/2019/08/27/feedback-loops.html). After discussed and filled up information eventually today was presentation day. All teams lead including me were in the meeting room and started to present.

We thought it would take a few minutes per person, but we took over 10 minutes per person. Moreover, there were questions in some point and took time to answer.

Finally, we took 2 hours to finish the meeting and went back home.
